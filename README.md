# human_seat_vibration_damper
Design, fabrication, simulation and testing of a viscous dash-pot for a car seat vibration setup. 

This was a project that Varun worked on during his junior year of undergraduate studies at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, in 2016-17.

Please have a look at the Documentation for theoretical foundations and the design. 

'ENDSemReport3-2.pdf' contains the piston and the vibration setup design (along with the electrodynamic shaker and the sensor-DAQ system) used for the system identification of a passive damper. This design project was further extended to create our very own magnetorhelogical damper. The report also lists three (unsuccessful) attempts to design and fabricate one.

'HumanSeatVibration.pdf' is a short assignment, as part of a course on vibrations and control, that models the dynamics of a seated human body and finds the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of excitation.
